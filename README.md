# 🐞 Bug Report Manager

This is a **side project** that summarizes bug reports using multiple AI agents and sends the results via email.  
It’s built in a Jupyter Notebook and uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for email delivery.

  - Clarification request
  - HTML formatting
  - Evaluation agent
- 📨 **Automatic Email Sending** (via Resend API).
- ⚙️ **Environment-based config** using `.env` file.
- 🖥️ **Built as a Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehra1812shivam/bug-report-manager.gitcd bug-report-manager
```

### 2. Setup a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a `.env` file
Add your keys inside `.env` (this file is **ignored by git**):

```ini

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

# Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key_here
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### Run inside Jupyter Notebook
1. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `bu_summarizer.ipynb`.
3. Provide input like this:

```
Bug: When I click submit on the form, the UI freezes and nothing is saved.
Severity: High
Environment: Production
Recipient email: ['dev-team@example.com']
```

4. Run all cells — this will:
   - Generate summaries from multiple agents.
   - Format them into HTML.
   - Send the email using Resend API.
